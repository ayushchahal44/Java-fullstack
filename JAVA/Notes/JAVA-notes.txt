Java is a high level programming language which is easily readable, understandable and instructible by programmer.
Java is a platform independent lang.? - because in java source code is converted into byte code which is easily executable in any platform which has JVM.
JVM- it stands for java virtual machine it is physically doesn't exist. it is used to convert byte code into binary code. it consist of JIT and interpreter
JRE - it stands for Java Runtime environment it is physically exist it is used to provide environment to run java program.
JDK - it stands for Java development kit. it is physically exists it provides an environment to run as well as to develop a java program.

printing statements -
System.out.print(data); - after printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in same line.
System.out.println(data); - after printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in new line.



Tokens:-
The smallest part of java program is known as tokens.
Types of tokens:-
1. Keywords - the words which are having predefined meaning is known as keywords. it is also known as compiler aware words. Keywords are always should be in a lowercase. in java we have 50+ keywords. example - class, public, static, void.
2. Identifiers - the name given by programmer is known as identifier.   i. we cannot use keywords as a identifier.   ii. we cannot use space.   iii. we can't start with numbers.   iv. special characters are not allowed except $ and _. examples - class Name, variable Name, method Name, package Name.
3. Literals - the input provided by the programmer i. number ii. character iii. string iv. Boolean
4. Separators - it used to separate java members.
{} - blocks
() - equations, methods declaration, condition
; - end of the statements
, - variables
. - reference
5. Operators -
1. unary operator -
i. new
ii. increment -
a. pre increment - ++variable;
b. post increment - variable++;
iii. decrement -
a. pre
b. post
iv. logical not
2. Binary operator -
i. Arithmetic
ii. relational
iii. logical AND & logical OR 
iv. Components of Assignment
3. Ternary operator - i. Conditional



Data Type:- it is used to define what type of data we are storing inside the memory.
1. Primitive Datatype :-
Integer number
byte - 1 byte - 8 bits.
short - 2 byte - 16 bits
int - 4 byte - 32 bits
long - 8 byte - 64 bits
Floating number
float - 4 byte - 32 bits
double - 8 byte - 64 bits
Character
char - 2 byte - 16 bits
Boolean True & False
Boolean - 1 bit

2. Non-primitive Datatype :-
String
Class Name
Array



Types of variable :-
1. Based on datatype -
i. Primitive variable
ii. Non-Primitive variable
2. Based on Scope -
i. Local variable - a variable declare inside local area is known as local variable. we cannot use local variables without initialization. local variables are not assigned with default values. we cannot create 2 local variables with same name. local variable can be use only inside same local area. Note- We can use global variables inside global area as well as local area.
ii. Global variable -
a. static variable - a variable which is declared inside class area or global area prefix with static keyword is known as static variables.
b. non-static variable - a variable which is declared inside class area or global area without static keyword is known as non-static variables.

    }
}



solve:
int a =10;
++a;
int b=++a - 5;
int c=++b - ++a + 5;
int a = ++c - ++b - b;


Rules and Steps for pre increment:-
1. Increase the value by 1.
2. Update the incremented value in the same variable.
3. If any operation is going on we will use incremented value.


solve:
int a = -10;
int b = -5 + ++a;
a = ++b + b - b + ++b;
int c = ++a - ++b - 10 +5;
b = ++a + ++c;
to find: i. a? ii. b? operation(b++) iii. c?


solve:
int a = -5;
int b = a++ + 5;
int c = b++ + a++ +5;
a = c++ + c +5;
to show: a++, b, c++, a;


Rules and Steps for post increment:-
1. Increase the value by 1.
2. Update the incremented value in the same variable.
3. If any operation is going on we will use current value (previous of incremented value).


int a = 10;
int b = a++ - ++a;
int c = a++ + ++b - ++a + b;
a = c++ + ++b -c + ++c;
to show: b, c++, a

Some Quick Question And Answers :-
1. write a difference between Primitive and non Primitive data type.
--> Primitive data type are predefined as keywords where the size is fixed meanwhile non Primitive datatypes are defined by the programmer where data size can also be manipulated.
2. write a difference between local and global variable.
--> local variable are only accessible in the local scope where there is no default value is provided to them on the other hand global variables can be access through the global scope and have default value.
3. write difference between compiler and interpreter.
--> compiler works as the intermediate between high level language and the low level language it runs whole code in one go on the other hand the interpreter works line by line to complete the work.
4. Difference between platform dependent and platform independent.
--> the platform dependent can be described as when any of the source code or the work need to be done only on the specific specification machine meanwhile if the source code or the work can be done without the intervene of the platform is called platform independent. ex - java is platform independent.
5. how does OOPS nature of java helps in software development?
--> oops concept make it to use again and again and make it so readable and portable.
6. why java is considered simple language compare to c or c++?
-> java reduced the manual memory allocation and complex works to do manually and make it easy and simple.
7. how does java provides security at the runtime?
-> 
8. what makes java as robust language?
-> Java gives features like memory allocation, garbage collection, error handling make it robust language.
9. how does java achieve high performance?
--> Java uses Just in time compiler (JIT) to achieve high performance while compiling on the run time.
10. what do you mean by portability in java?
--> Portability means the java code can run anytime when written one time. A single code can you used many time.
11. why does java have strong industry adoption and job opportunities?
--> Java is mostly used in software industries, banking and development sectors make it to create more jobs and widely spread.




Arithmetic Operation :-
Addition - byte + byte , short + short , char + char = CTE others are success.


Components of Assignment - Arithmetic + Assignment.
a+=b -> a = a + b
a-=b -> a = a - b
a*=b -> a = a * b
a/=b -> a = a / b
a%=b -> a = a % b

Relational Operator :-
- Comparison
- Binary
- return type should be boolean type
- example: <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
- string with boolean will only supports == and !=.

Logical Operator :-
- Relational operator is Mandatory.
    - Condition - > 2 operands
- return type boolean
- logical op it takes condition
- Logical AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)



Conditional operator :-
- Ternary operator
- syntax:
   op1 ? op2 : op3 
condition ? true : false


Task: find largest between 3 values. by conditional operator.

Type Casting :-
2 types:- 
1. Primitive typecasting [Not recommending] - Converting 1 Primitive data type to 2nd Primitive data type. 

- Widening - (implicit) 
byte < short/char < int < long < float < double                (increasing order :- small range to large range.)
Cannot convert boolean
Done by the compiler
example :- byte b1 = 123;
short s1 = b1;
now, s1 is 123;

- Narrowing -  (explicit) 
double > float > long > int > short/char > byte                 (decreasing order :- large range to small range.)
Done by programmer - use of typecast operator 
example :- small primitive datatype var = (smaller range datatype) larger datatype var;
-> int i=150;
byte b = (byte) i; // now b = 106 (first go high to 127 then come start counting from -ve smallest and go on... like :- 0 to 127 then -128 then to -1 again 0 to 127 next -128 and carry on...)
int 128 is byte -128;


2. Non - Primitive typecasting [Highly recommending]




Scanner Class :-
steps:-
- import java.util.Scanner;
- Declare Scanner class object  - class block as well as method block. - can be static also.
- Scanner object reference name = new Scanner(System.in);   // the address is static.

-> inbuild Methods of Scanner class.
- nextByte(), nextShort(), nextInt(), nextLong(), nextFloat(), nextDouble(), nextBoolean(), next().charAt(index), next() {only 1 word}, nextLine() {Group of word},
-> datatype var = scanner obj.inbuild method

-> Resource leak (warning)  {Method block}   to avoid it -> object.close();
